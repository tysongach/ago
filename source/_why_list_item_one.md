At the 2018 AGO Convention in Kansas City, you will see and hear incredible
performances by world-class organists and choirs; hear new music by some of the
world’s  nest modern composers; be able to check out dozens of workshops and
seminars; and enjoy creative worship services in some of the most beautiful and
historic organ venues in the country. The organists of Kansas City look forward
