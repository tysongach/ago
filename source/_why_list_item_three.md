We are well-known for our jazz and our barbecue, but we have grown into much
more than that. Our wide boulevards and numerous fountains are emblematic of the
cityâ€™s European-inspired design, while the flourishing arts scene has produced a
new generation of local craftspeople, gifted artisans, and creative manufacturers.
Kansas City has much more to offer than you may know. Experience it firsthand
and find your new favorite&nbsp;city.
