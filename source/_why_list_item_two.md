Kansas City is currently experiencing a wonderful cultural rebirth, and this
convention will take place in the middle of it all. Energetic and attractive
neighborhoods throughout the city are highlighted by world class performing arts
venues, beautiful bars and restaurants, and a wide array of cultural hot spots
such as museums, coffee shops, breweries, art galleries, and parks. Forbes named
Kansas City one of “America’s Best Downtowns”; Huffington Post named it “Coolest
City in America” in 2014; Time awarded KC “America’s Best City for BBQ”; and it
was the first US city with access to Google’s ultra–high–speed internet
service, Google&nbsp;Fiber.
